# Covid19-Capstone

This project integrated two large COVID-19 patient datasets from the Mexican Ministry of Health to predict ICU admissions and mortality using machine learning models. Data cleaning, integration, and feature engineering ensured the datasets were standardized and reliable. A total of 14 varying models were developed to evaluate prediction accuracy. The champion model, DT_M_F1, achieved an accuracy of 88.2% and a recall of 94.6%, highlighting its effectiveness in identifying patients at high risk of mortality.
